Sensor data collection and lighting automation using ESP8266

An IoT project aimed at collecting sensor data from the analog pin of the Node-MCU board and displaying live updates of the data in a webpage with timestamps. The user can also turn on lights (or any electrical appliances) using the buttons provided on the index file.

Requirements:
1. An ESP8266 Node-MCU board.
2. An output card(I have used 3 LEDs coloured Yellow, Red and Green).

Installation:
```
const char* ssid = "Indrasish";              //my wifi connection name
const char* password = "Indra117";           //my wifi password
```

Change the ssid and password in the `.ino` file as required.
